# Welcome

Welcome to the Yesler Community Collaborative ([YCC](http://yescollab.org/)) ParcelSearch tool.

The purpose of this tool is to empower YCC partners to identify sites where affordable housing could be developed. 

While using this tool, please be aware of the following points:

  - this tool is **very slow** -- allow 20-30 seconds to pass before seeing "refreshed" map results
  - this is an unfinished, draft product and therefore may contain "bugs"
  - the City of Seattle requests that all applications making use of their data provide a disclaimer (see the 'Notes' tab on the navigation bar above)
